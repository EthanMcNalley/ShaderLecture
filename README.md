# ShaderLecture
Completed work: Implemented MultiUV, View Directon, World Position, and Reflection shaders.
Reflection: I'd say my strengths are following along with the provided examples and fixing errors where they exist. I'm good at identifying where the problem is and how to fix it in a timely manner. As for weaknesses, I'd say understanding how shaders are programmed, so I tend to just rely on the tutorials. I can take this opportunity to improve upon my understanding and try to comprehend why things are the way they are, like how to create structs and half4s. I can do this by attempting to create simpler shaders that use these aspects and seeing if I notice patterns with how they are made.
